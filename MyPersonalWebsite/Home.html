            <p>Many of us arrive at our careers by chance. I actively pursued a career
                in development. My life in broadcasting, however, was a different matter. I attended a private
                religious high school in Ashland, Oregon, at which I was able to earn most of my tuition in exchange
                for working at their radio station. After leaving the Marine Corps, I was somewhat at
                sixes and sevens as I acclimated to civilian life. On a lark, I called a local radio station in 
                Klamath Falls, Oregon, to see if they had an opening. They hired me on the spot for the evening music shift.
                Luck. Timing.

                Today, after 36 years, I'm once again on

                It's been such a pleasure to be back on the air at my one of my old stomping grounds. I've enjoyed being 
                back on the air so much that I'm now pursuing other contract voice over and voice track opportunities.

            <p>The most important contributor to my enjoyment of any hobby is gear. It's <span class="bolder italicized">all</span> all about the gear.
                After a lifetime of living in the Pacific Northwest, I know this: I <span class="italicized">will</span>
                get wet. When I'm on my bike, I know that dark cloud ahead has my name on it.
                Gear, baby. Lots of it. Bags. Rain gear. Gloves. Heated clothing. Best helmet available in my budget.
                It all adds up to ensure that I'm not riding distracted by physical discomfort so I can focus on
                 staying out of the way and out of the hospital.

            <h2 class="sans level2 moreTopSpacePlus10 lessBottomSpace">These boots <span class="strikethrough">are</span> <span class="italicized">better be</span> made for walking 
                <span class="superSmol">[sorry, Nancy]</span></span></h2>
            <p>New riders choose their boots for different reasons: style, cool factor, safety. It's 
                not enough to think only about safety when selecting a riding boot.
                It's <span class="italicized">not</span> just about the journey.
                It's also about exploring those little nooks and crannies along the way.
                If those boots are safe or cool or sexy 
                <span class="italicized">and</span> painful? Well then, it's just no fun. It's as easy to find good boots
                that are cool and comfortable as it is to grab a brand name that doesn't fill the whole bill.
                I keep hoping that Uggs will start making riding boots.

            <p>The closest I will ever get to magic is to make a thing out of another thing.</p>

            <p>Let's talk a little more about gear. We tend to scrimp when we buy our first setup for 
                any new hobby - whether it's a cheap guitar only playable by someone who can palm a basketball,
                a scrappy used rat bike to learn on or grocery store knitting needles and bargain yarn.
                This approach isn't conducive to real enjoyment; it may cause so much frustration
                that you give up before you master the learning curve. You'll have enough to contend with 
                when you're first learning. You don't need to fight with your gear, too.
            </p>

            <p>Buy good yarn. Buy good needles. Buy the best you can afford. Don't miss out on the pleasures
                of your new hobby by shortchanging yourself on supplies.
