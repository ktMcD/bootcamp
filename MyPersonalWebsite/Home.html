                Today, I'm on <a href="https://streamdb3web.securenetsystems.net/v5/index.cfm?stationCallSign=KKRB">Sunny 107</a>.
                It's been such a pleasure to be back on the air in my one of my old stomping grounds.

            <p>Many of us end up falling into our careers by accident. I actively chose and pursued a career
                in development. My life in broadcasting was a total accident.

            <p>The most important contributor to my enjoyment of any hobby is gear. It's *all* all about the gear.</p>
            <p>I've lived in the Pacific Northwest all of my life. One thing I know for sure: I <emphasis>will</emphasis>
                get wet. When I'm on my bike, especially, I know that dark cloud ahead has my name on it.
                Gear, baby. Lots of it. Bags. Rain gear. Gloves. Heated clothing. Best helmet available in my budget.
                It all adds up to ensure that I'm not riding distracted by physical discomfort and have all of my
                attention available for staying out of the way and out of the hospital.

            <p>Let's talk a little more about gear. We tend to scrimp when we buy our first setup for 
                any new hobby whether it's a cheap guitar, a scrappy used rat bike to learn on or 
                plastic knitting needles. This approach, imho, isn't conducive to really enjoying your
                new hobby. That scrappy rat bike isn't going to get you very far and it might not even
                be safe. It's for sure that it's not going to imbue you with a tickly sparkly feeling
                when you ride it. Same with knitting supplies. Buy good yarn. Buy good needles right out of
                the gate. You'll have enough to contend with when you're first learning. You don't need to
                fight with your gear, too.
