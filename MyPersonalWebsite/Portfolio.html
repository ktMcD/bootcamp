            <p>Almost all of the projects in my git repository are from school projects. There are 
                a couple projects that are specific to my knitting hobby. One was written in Java 
                when I was just learning about object oriented programming. I still use it. </p>
            <p>My most recent project is the first project in my repo that is not a school assignment.
                Using the skills I've gained in the Full Stack C# .NET bootcamp I'm attending,
                I wrote a console application that extracts text from an XPS file (similar to PDF but
                not as useful). The application then processes the text line by line and creates 
                a skeleton script for my afternoon radio show. It saves me about 20 minutes because 
                I no longer have to use several files to put together my show.
            </p>

                    <li>Refactor for Opject Oriented Programming</li>
                    <li>Write a UI to accept specific hours so teammates can use it for 
                        different shifts</li>
                </ul>
